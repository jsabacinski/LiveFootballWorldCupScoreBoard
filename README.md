# LiveFootballWorldCupScoreBoard

Requirements:
- World Cup Scoreboard library 
- shows all the ongoing matches and their scores

The scoreboard supports the following operations:
1. Start a new game, assuming initial score 0 ï¿½ 0 and adding it the scoreboard. This should capture following parameters:
	a. Home team
	b. Away team
2. Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away team score.
3. Finish game currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
4. Get a summary of games in progress ordered by their total score. The games with the same total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the scoreboard.

## Assumptions 
- I will create a simple solution, my goal is to work time-boxed 
- I will create 2 projects	
  - Library - Domain logic (probably 2 classes: Game and Scoreboard)
  - Test - Unit Tests for Library
- I will document here my considerations
